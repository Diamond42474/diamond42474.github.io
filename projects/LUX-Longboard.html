    <h3>
      The LUX Longboard project is my latest in the line of embedded development. Using the ATTiny85 (a Microchip
      processor), I've been working on making reactive lighting for my longboard that uses the accelleration of the
      board to determine how the lights react.

      Project Details:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Phase One: The Inspiration<br>
      The project started with me wanting lights on my longboard so that I can ride at night with style. While I was
      thinking what lights to put on, I figured I'm a programmer, so why not make mine the best? So I started by
      brainstorming ideas while I've been getting into embedded development and thought I could use the ATTiny85 for the
      brains of the operation. I started coding up the program, researching things I've never used before such as the
      ADC (analog to digital converter) or built-in timers for PWM. I then setup a small headless computer so if
      anything went wrong, I wouldn't fry my main computer.
      <br>
      <br>
      Phase Two: Testing<br>
      After the initial setup, I started testing.. a LOT... I set up a m "mock longboard" using a potentiometer and a
      bread board to imitate the acceleration and breaking of the board. Figuring out how all of the registers affected
      the timers and adc was tricky but it was fun, so I kept going. Eventually I came up with my first model and was
      ready to make the final design.
      <br>
      <br>
      Phase Three: Wiring<br>
      The next step to the plan was making the circuit that would be attached to my bored. I started by laying out all
      of the components onto a PCB to see how everything would fit together, and got to soldering. From my 4 years of
      FRC and soldering a ridiculous mount of pins, this part was fairly easy (other than the fact that to this day I
      have to burn myself at least once). I got the board all put together and not it was ready to go!
      <br>
      <br>
      Phase Four: The Downfall of Nerd-kind<br>
      After weeks of designing, testing, wiring, and head-pounding, I had finally connected it all together and to the
      board.. aaaaaaaaand... nothing happened... I sat there with my board wondering why on earth nothing is turning on,
      thinking maybe something broke while I was working on it. I took my voltage meter and measured everything and it
      all looked fine, so I plugged it back in and once again there was no light. I poked around with my voltage meter
      for what seemed like hours until I finally figured it out. The amps going to the wire that I was tapping into to
      werent enough, meaning that whenever I applied any load to it, the voltage immedietly dropped to about 1.9 volts,
      which is a problem, because I need this thing at 5v. So back to the drawing board I went...
      <br>
      <br>
      Phase Five: Rise of the Resistance<br>
      After spending weeks to months on this project and it end up failing, I decided to quit.... Juuuuuuust kidding, I
      wasn't even close to giving up, because when I want to get something done, I'm going to do it, even if it looks
      different from what I originally planned. It was time to get back to work. Early in the planning days, I debated
      using an accelerometer but decided against it so I could instead use the internal components and not have
      anything outside of the already existing circuit bay in the board. But times have changed, and so have I... The
      biggest problem I faced now was figuring out how to get the voltage supply I needed. Well for you guys that don't
      know, electric longboards have a GIANT battery pack that's putting out about 40v and a LOT of amps. But wait, I
      thought I needed 5v, and using resistors would waste way too much energy and cause too much heat? During this
      process is when I found one of many beautiful things, and that's called a drop-down buck-converter! Problem
      solved!... I might or might not have melted a component while measuring voltages earlier, so I already needed to
      go in and re-solder the wire that connects to the battery. Some crimping for JST connectors and a little bit of
      soldering later, I now have a solid connection to the beautiful 40v of raging electricity!

      Phase Six: The Return of the Sixth<br>
      Coming soon...
